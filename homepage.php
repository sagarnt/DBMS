          an insurance company, wherein the latter promises to provide financial
          protection to the former against healthcare expenses, as per
          pre-decided terms and conditions. Medical insurance covers healthcare
          expenses for illnesses or injuries. The expenses incurred on your
          healthcare bills or compensating the healthcare directly on your
          behalf, are taken care in a health insurance policy. Compare and buy
